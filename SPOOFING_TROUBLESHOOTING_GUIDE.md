## 🔍 **STEP-BY-STEP DEBUGGING PROCESS:**

### **STEP 1: Verify Module Installation**
1. **Install the APK** on your device
2. **Open LSPosed Manager**
3. **Check that PixelSpoof is listed** in modules
4. **Enable the module** if it's not already
5. **Reboot the device** after enabling

### **STEP 2: Check Module Scope**
1. **Open LSPosed → PixelSpoof**
2. **Go to Scope section**
3. **Enable "System Framework"** ✅
4. **Enable the device info app** you're testing with ✅
5. **Common apps to enable:**
   - Device Info HW
   - CPU-Z
   - AIDA64
   - Droid Hardware Info
   - Phone INFO ★SAM★
   - System Framework (CRITICAL!)

### **STEP 3: Check Xposed Logs**
1. **Open LSPosed → Logs**
2. **Look for PixelSpoof entries**
3. **You should see logs like:**
   ```
   🎯 PIXELSPOOF ACTIVE - Hooking package: [app_name]
   🔧 Initializing COMPREHENSIVE property spoofing
   ✅ SystemProperties hooks installed
   ✅ Build class fields hooked
   ```

### **STEP 4: Test with Enhanced Debug Version**
**This new APK includes comprehensive logging:**
- 📝 Logs ALL property requests
- 🎯 Shows which properties are being spoofed
- ⚠️ Identifies properties NOT in our spoof list
- 🧪 Tests property access when device info apps start

## 🚨 **COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:**

### **Issue 1: Module Not Loading**
**Symptoms:** No logs appear in LSPosed
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Ensure LSPosed is working (test with other modules)
- ✅ Check that "Riru" or "Zygisk" is properly installed
- ✅ Verify device is rooted with Magisk
- ✅ Clear LSPosed cache and reboot

### **Issue 2: Wrong Scope Configuration**
**Symptoms:** Logs appear but spoofing doesn't work
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Enable "System Framework" in module scope
- ✅ Enable the specific app you're testing
- ✅ Try enabling "All Apps" temporarily
- ✅ Reboot after scope changes

### **Issue 3: App Using Different Property Methods**
**Symptoms:** Some properties spoofed, others not
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Check logs for "NOT SPOOFED" entries
- ✅ Look for patterns in unspoofed properties
- ✅ May need to add specific properties to our list

### **Issue 4: Anti-Xposed Detection**
**Symptoms:** App crashes or shows "rooted device" warnings
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Use Hide My Applist
- ✅ Enable LSPosed "Hide Module" option
- ✅ Use Shamiko to hide root
